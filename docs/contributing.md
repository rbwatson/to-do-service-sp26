# Contributing

Welcome to the To-Do Service.
Your contributions are welcome.
There's not much _code_ to contribute, but there is a lot of room to improve
the documentation.

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, **please review
the information in this page first**.

You are welcome to just jump in and create new topics and pull requests.
But, this is likely to result in stern warnings about breaking some rule or another.
While that's one way to learn and improve, most warning messages just send you back
to one of the references in this section.

Perhaps that's why you're here?

By whatever path that brought you here, here you are, and you are most welcome.
Enjoy your visit.

## Start here

- [Configure your system](./before-you-start-a-tutorial.md) correctly.
    This makes it easier to create a documentation update that works with the existing content.

    While it's possible to make minor edits in the GitHub web site without installing the required software,
    **this isn't recommended**.
    Such changes must be minor and, if you make a mistake, you must start over.

    **For the best contributor experience, install the required software and configure it correctly.**
- Review the [Writer's guide](./contributors-guide/writers-guide.md) and
    the other documents in this section.
    They tell you what your documentation update should look like and how to fix errors.

    - The [Documentation requirements](./contributors-guide/documentation-requirements.md)
    describes this in greater detail and identifies the errors returned by the automated testing.
    - The [Validation errors](./contributors-guide/validation-errors-table.md) describes
    the errors in more detail. Most of the errors also have links to documentation about
    how to resolve errors found by the automated testing.

Again, your contributions are welcome.
