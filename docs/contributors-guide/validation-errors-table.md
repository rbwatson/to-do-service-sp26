## Notes

### Severity levels

**Error** - Validation fails, unable to merge PR until fixed

**Warning** - Validation passes but still has issues to address

**Info** - Informational message, no action required

### Message format

Messages shown in GitHub Actions annotations use this format:

```text
::level file=path,line=number::message
```

For example:

```text
::error file=docs/api/users.md,line=45::Line length exceeds 100 characters
::warning file=docs/guide.md::Front matter is recommended for assignment files
```

### Help links

Help links appear in the console output after the error message:

```text
Help: https://github.com/UWC2-APIDOC/to-do-service-sp26/wiki/Squashing-Commits
```

### MarkdownLint rules

For MarkdownLint errors, the rule number, such as `MD013`, appears in the error message.
You can look up rules at:

<https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md>

### Vale rules

For Vale errors, the style and rule name appear in the format `Style.Rule`.
Rules come from these style packages:

- Vale (core rules)
- Google (Google Developer Documentation Style Guide)
- write-good (readability checks)
- Readability (Flesch-Kincaid and other metrics)

### API test error details

API test errors include additional context in the console output:

- The curl command used
- The actual HTTP status code received
- Specific JSON differences between actual and expected responses
- JSON path notation for mismatched fields

### Tool test failures

If validation tool tests fail,
the pytest output shows which tests failed and why.
Fix broken tools to continue with other validation runs.
